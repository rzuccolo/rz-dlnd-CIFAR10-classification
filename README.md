# rz-dlnd-CIFAR10-classification

In this project, we classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. We preprocess the images, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples. The images are normalized and the labels one-hot encoded. That is an introduction to integrate convolution, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers. At the end, we get to see the neural network's predictions on sample images.

This is a project executed during Udacity Deep Learning Foundation.
